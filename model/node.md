# Node

A node represents a location within the navigational structure of a website. The linking of nodes as parent-child relationships forms the hierarchical structure of a website, with a node having a single parent and (optionally) multiple child nodes. A single entry can optionally be assigned to a node.

## Properties

| Name | Type | Format | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :-- | :---------- |
| id | string | GUID | The unique identifier for the node |
| parentId | string | GUID | The identifier of the parent node |
| projectId | string | | The project identifier, e.g. 'movieDb'. Found in the project overview screen of the management console |
| name | string | Lower-cased with no special characters except hyphens | The name of the node and unique to it's container, e.g. 'about-us' |
| title | string | | The display name for the node |
| entryId | GUID | | The identifier of the associated entry if assigned. |
| language | [Language code](/localization.md) | | The language that the node represents |
| path | string | URI path | The path of the node |
| hasChildren | boolean | | 'true' if the node has any descendants; 'false' otherwise. This can to be used to determine whether a call to request children is required |
| children | node[] | | If a depth is specified when requesting a node then the children field would include the descendant nodes to the specified depth |
