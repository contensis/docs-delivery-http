# Linked content
An entry can link to other entries or assets as [entry](/model/entry.md), [asset](/model/asset.md) or [image](/model/image.md) field types. They can be defined as a standard entry fields or as a [composed](/model/composed.md) field type in the content type. These link objects can be singular or arrays of links of the same content type e.g. Actors.

Linked content can be [unresolved](#unresolved-entries) or [resolved](#resolved-entries) depending on whether a linkDepth value has been provided.

## Unresolved entries
An unresolved entry or asset is essentially a subset of the entry structure with enough information to get the correct entry language variation. A subsequent HTTP call is required to obtain the linked content. Unresolved entries and assets is the default behaviour for linked content.

## Properties
| Name | Type | Format | Description |
| :------- | :--- | :----- | :---------- |
| id | string | GUID | The entry identifier as a 128 bit GUID |
| dataFormat | string | | Either *entry* or *asset* |
| language | string | [Language code](/localization.md) | [Optional] The language code of the linked entry variation |

### Example
This example shows an unresolved entry.

```json
{
    "id": "0a48e187-43e0-4df0-ae62-8eba4d478036",
    "dataFormat": "entry",
    "language": "en-GB"
}
```

## Resolved entries
Entries can be resolved automatically to a maximum depth of 10 using the linkDepth parameter in any retrieval operation. Being able to resolve entries in a single HTTP call can significantly improve the render performance of your webpage or application. Whilst fewer network requests can be beneficial, it can also be detrimental if the linkDepth is too deep, or if there are many link fields.


### Resolution rules
When a linkDepth is provided to an entry retrieval operation, then the following rules apply:

- If a language **is** specified, then the specific language variation will be returned
- If a language **is** specified but the specific language variation does not exist, then null will be returned or will not be included in the array
- If a language **is not** specified, then the *defaultLanguage* value defined in the [content type](/model/content-type.md) will be used to select the appropriate entry variation to return.
- If a language **is not** specified and there is no default variation, then null is returned.
